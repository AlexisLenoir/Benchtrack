pyAgrum is a Python wrapper for the C++ aGrUM library (using SWIG interface generator). It provides a high-level interface to the part of aGrUM allowing to create, model, learn, use, calculate with and embed Bayesian Networks and other graphical models. Some specific (python and C++) codes are added in order to simplify and extend the aGrUM API.
